"""Wayne Manor: the virtual smart home Alfred controls by voice (lights, temperature, the
desk telephone and Spotify), through its MCP server.

voice.py adds these tools to the router's at the start of every conversation. They're
listed afresh each time because the music tools only exist while Spotify is enabled. If
the house can't be reached, that conversation simply goes on without it.

Pipecat's MCP client does the work: it turns Wayne Manor's tools into router tools, runs
them when the router calls them, reconnects if Wayne Manor restarts, and closes with the
session. Wayne Manor's answers are sentences written to be spoken, refusals included.
