"""The sound of a timer that's done or an alarm going off, repeated until you answer.

A timer beeps for up to TIMER_SECONDS; an alarm plays for up to ALARM_SECONDS. Saying
"stop" (or "snooze", for an alarm) silences it: announcer.py hears that at once, or the
router's stop_ringing tool does it. Echo cancellation removes the sound from what Alfred
hears, so he can still hear you over it. The sound waits while Alfred is speaking, so
it never chops up his words.
