"""When a conversation closes. GPT-Live bills for every open second, silence included.

What counts is Alfred: his speaking, his tool calls, his looking something up. Speech he
never answers (a song's lyrics, a TV, people nearby) doesn't keep him awake. After about
`idle_seconds` without him, a soft warning tone plays; if nobody speaks within
WARNING_SECONDS, the session closes (and __main__.py plays the sleep sound). While a job
is running or waiting for your answer, or a timer or alarm rings, Alfred stays open longer,
up to KEEP_OPEN_SECONDS, so you hear the result or the question, or can say "stop".

Speaking after the warning holds the session open, once per quiet stretch, until Alfred
answers: he has ANSWER_SECONDS after you finish (RESCUE_SECONDS at most), or it closes.
During the warning, our own microphone check (audio_log.py) also counts: it hears you a
moment before GPT-Live reports you speaking, which matters right at the deadline.

Told to go to sleep (greeting.py), the session closes as soon as
Alfred's goodbye ends: no warning tone, nothing said after it keeps it open, and it is
cancelled at once rather than closed politely (that takes about a second more).
