"""Messages to Google Chat: "tell the family chat I'm running late".

Each space is a Google Chat incoming webhook, set in .env as ALFRED_GOOGLE_CHAT_<NAME>
(config.py). Nothing is sent without your spoken yes: Alfred reads the message back and
asks, the same way a background job asks before sending an email (questions.py). The
question is asked as "job 0" so your answer finds its way here. Every message, sent or
not, goes to the audit log; webhook addresses carry a key, so they are never logged.
