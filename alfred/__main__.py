"""Start Alfred: `uv run alfred`.

The whole program is one loop:
    listen for "Hey Alfred" -> wake sound -> talk with GPT-Live -> (idle) -> sleep sound
    -> listen again

Background jobs (tasks.py) run alongside that loop; a soft chime plays when one finishes.
Alfred also chimes and speaks up without the wake word when a reminder goes off, or a job
needs your answer (not during quiet hours, except reminders). After each conversation,
memory.py notes anything worth remembering.

Logging is set up in logs.py; everything long-lived is built in services.py.
