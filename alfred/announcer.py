"""What Alfred says without being asked: about background jobs, and reminders.

- A job finishes or asks you something, or a reminder goes off, while you talk:
  GPT-Live is told, and says it.
- It happened between conversations: the next conversation opens with it.
- Right after Alfred asks "may I…?", a clear spoken yes or no in your next reply goes
  straight to the job. GPT-Live sometimes said "I'll pass that along" without doing it;
  this doesn't rely on it. Anything else you say first leaves the answer to GPT-Live.
- Each conversation starts knowing your recent jobs, so "what happened?" isn't a blank.
- While a timer or alarm rings, "stop" or "snooze" works at once, without the round trip
  through GPT-Live.
