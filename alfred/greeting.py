"""What Alfred says when you wake him, and how you send him to sleep.

Waking: "Hey Alfred" on its own gets a short greeting ("Yes, sir?"). "Hey Alfred, what
time is it?" doesn't: he just answers. Speech after the wake word is held back until the
GPT-Live session opens, then sent; if GPT-Live hears you start speaking soon after, it was
a request. Its speech detection is used rather than our own microphone check, which the
wake chime's echo and the Pi's noisier microphone both fooled.

Sleeping: "Alfred, go to sleep" is recognised here, from what you said, not by a model:
GPT-Live said "Goodnight, sir." but often didn't hand the request on. It counts when the
whole sentence is the command ("sleep right now", "I said go to sleep"), so "remind me to
go to sleep at 11" is left alone; or when you mentioned sleep and Alfred answered with
nothing but a goodnight. Alfred says goodnight and the session closes as soon as he's done
(idle.py). Jobs keep running, timers and alarms still ring, waiting questions are asked
next time, and "Hey Alfred" wakes him.
